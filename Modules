Typescript uses ES6 modules.

Interfaces are like a contracts.
We can also import interfaces via modules.

import { IShip } from './IShip';

export class Ship implements IShip{
  private shipName: string;
  
  public get name(){
    return this.shipName;
  }

  public takeOff: void{
    //implement something
  }
}

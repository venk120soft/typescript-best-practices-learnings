I have added the concepts to Improve Wesite Performance using Debouncing and Throttling

Throttling is a technique in which, no matter how many times the user fires the event, 
the attached function will be executed only once in a given time interval.
setTimeOut can be used for this

In the debouncing technique, no matter how many times the user fires the event, 
the attached function will be executed only after the specified time once the user stops firing the event.
setTimeOut and clearTimeout(timerId) can be used to implement this.

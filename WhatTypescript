Static typing means, when we declare a variable with string number, boolean etc.. that type can't be changed . 

function combineNames(first : string, second: string)
{
return first+ " "+ second;
}
const firstName: string ="Venkatesh";
const secondName: string="CH";

combineNames(firstName, secondName)// in case if you gives here number then you will get the compile time error this is what static typing.

Classes and Interfaces.

interface IPerson{
  firstName: string;
  lastName: string;
  age: number;
}

//creating the variable of type 
const myVariable: IPerson = {
  firstName: 'Venkatesh',
  lastName:'CH',
  age:'29'
}
//While you are using the type as Interface, then It should have same number of properties(should not be less or more) and the type of the properties should be same.

// Extending the Interfaces in Class.

interface IShip{
  name: string;
  takeOff(): void;
}

class Ship implements IShip{
  private shipName: string;
  
  public get name(){
  return this.shipName;
  }
  public takeOff(): void{
  //implement something
  }
}
